/**
 * Extension to the AIFL algorithm based on "Adaptive Interaction Fault Location Based on Combinatorial Testing".
 * In each new iteration, test inputs are generated based on the failed test inputs of the previous generation.
 * The algorithm stops if there either were no failed test inputs in the last iteration, or the number of iterations
 * is now greater than the testing strength, or if the number of suspicious combinations did not change during the
 * last iteration, or if the number of iterations is below a defined threshold (default: 1).
 * Consequently, the algorithm always terminates.
 * <p>
 * Important Information:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Generates many additional test inputs if there are many parameters
 *     <li>Generates many additional test inputs if there are many failing test inputs
 *     <li>Does not order failure-inducing combinations by probability and can return quite a few of them
 *     <li>Is a bit more exact than AIFL itself, but needs considerably more test inputs
 *     <li>Does not consider constraints
 * </ul>
